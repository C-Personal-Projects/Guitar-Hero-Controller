# Guitar Hero Project
This is a repository for a guitar hero controller that is compatible with Windows computers. It is 3D printed, powered by an Arduino Leonardo, and connects to the computer through a USB cable. This project involves the use of a PCB that allows the frets to light up in their respective colors when they are pressed.
